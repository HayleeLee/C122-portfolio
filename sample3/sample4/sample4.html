    <p class="p-1"><span>General behaviors</span><br>
    Both sent and recevied images were often of low image quality(~72dpi). Often the camera was out of focus, leaving the image to be blurry, and the alignment of spaces were uneven all throughout. The low image quality was inferred to be an indicator of the relationship status of the two individuals the image was being exchanged with: the lower the quality, the more comfortable the two individuals were with each other.
        </p>
     <p class="p-1"><span>Oddities</span><br>However, there were some images that were high in resolution(300dpi). Images with higher resolution also tended to have even alignment in spacing and composition. While a low image quality was a strong indicator of people's sense of comfort with each other, there were few instances when this scenario wasn't completely true</p>
